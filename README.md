## Cython Project
This is an example Cython Project that demonstrates how a C++ file can be executed during a Python program through Cython. The program in question is for a Secure Coding Class, in which a
flaw has been added to the code of this tip calculation application for other students to find. The program allows the user to add a tip amount to a given total from a meal using a Python Front End and Structure
and a Python and C/C++ back end.

This project was built using Python 3.11 It is therefore recommended that you attempt to run the main.py file with that Python 3.11, others may work but this is not guranteed.
You must have a compatible version of Python to run this project.
(You do not need to install the Cython Package to run this project)
